Creating a Super Smash Bros Melee Agent with Reinforcement Learning

Agent can go from the main menu to verus mode to fight a level 9 luigi bot and will start a match on yoshi's story

Currently all the agent only knows how to chase and down-b when in a match (and it doesnt do that well)

Taking some time to think about how to best implentent the Reinforcement Learning
